May 17th Update Log

1. Realized that the WorldMapProject is larger than I initially anticipated and will require significant experimentation.
2. Decided to create a series of mini-project repositories to learn the necessary skill sets before proceeding.
3. Will keep progress updated here.
4. On May 17th, decided to work on a “Picture-to-Phone Screen Size” application to learn about image upload, download, resizing, and saving images to mobile devices.
